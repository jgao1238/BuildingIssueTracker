# BuildingIssueTracker
Serving as a RA this year at college, sometimes issues are too minor to require a tedious and time consuming incident report. For example, a faulty water fountain would not necessarily require a detailed report for one line. However, records still need to be kept in case there is a history of reoccurring issues. This simple app allows staff members in one building to track any building issues without needing an external report for record keeping purposes.
